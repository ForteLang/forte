# Forte lang Specification v1

Status: **Implementation-conformant** (this document precisely describes the language accepted by the implementation in the repository).
The v0 draft (forte-lang-v0.md) is retained as a higher-level document containing design intent and future plans.
Corresponding implementation: `crates/fortelang` (parser/checker/compiler); verification: `cargo test -p fortelang`.

## 1. File Structure

```
file := { import } { device | block } [ song ]
```

- A file with a `song` = a **song** (legacy alias: a named root block —
  structurally a song IS a block).
- A file with top-level `block`s (and no song) = a **block library**:
  importable, and directly buildable — `forte build`/`play` use the LAST
  top-level block as the root.
- A file with neither = a **device library** (importable; `forte check`
  instantiates every device with default values and verifies it).
- Evaluation is entirely compile-time. Runtime I/O, clocks, and unseeded randomness do not exist in the language.

## 2. Lexical Structure

- Encoding is UTF-8. Identifiers: `[A-Za-z_@][A-Za-z0-9_@#]*`.
- Comments: `// to end of line`, `/* … */` (multi-line allowed).
- Numbers: `12`, `0.5`; negation is a prefix `-`. **Unit suffixes** are written immediately adjacent to the number:
  e.g. `96bpm` (only `bpm` carries meaning in v1; others are not ignored but are subject to checking).
- Strings: `"…"` (single line).
- Music literals: a backquote `` `…` `` immediately following `beat` / `notes` / `prog` (multi-line allowed).
- Symbols: `{ } ( ) : , / - .. . =`

## 3. Grammar (EBNF, implementation-conformant)

```ebnf

## 4. Semantics

### 4.1 song Header

| Element | Meaning | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tempo 96bpm` | Tempo | **Required**. 20..400 (E-TIME-003) |
| `swing 0.62` | Delays even-position 16th notes (MPC notation: 0.5 = straight, 0.66 ≈ shuffle, range 0.5..0.8). Applies only to notes on the grid |
| `meter 4/4` | Time signature | Denominator 2/4/8/16 (E-TIME-004). Engine beats = numerator × 4 / denominator |
| `key D minor` | Key | Root C..B (+#/b), scales major/minor/dorian/phrygian/lydian/mixolydian/locrian/harmonicminor/chromatic |
| `sample Sub = bounce(BD808(decay: 0.9), note: C1, beats: 2)` | Bounce-to-sample: render one hit of an instrument offline (same deterministic engine, +2 beats of tail) into an in-memory audio asset. `sampler(sample: Sub)` then plays that AUDIO — repitched relative to `note`, choppable, reversible. beats 0.05..32 (E-SMP-001); an unknown name at the sampler is E-SMP-002. Bounces resolve in declaration order, and a phrase bounce sees every bounce declared BEFORE it — resampling chains: bounce a source, wrap and produce it, bounce the production, wrap THAT. Block-internal samples resolve before the song's own, so a song-level `bounce(Mix)` of a block that PLACES machine blocks works: the whole mix becomes one record to chop (a rest then silences everything at once) | The audio-domain wrap: artifacts repitch along with the waveform, which oscillator pitch cannot do |
| `sample Rec = dig("../glitch/song.forte", beats: 16, skip: 16)` | Crate digging: compile and render ANOTHER SONG FILE (its imports, bounces and digs included) with the same deterministic engine, window it by `skip`/`beats`, by the source's own bars (`bars: 5..8`), or by a section NAME the source declares (`section: "drop"`, E-DIG-005 if missing — survives the record being rearranged; defaults: whole record), and register it as a sample asset rooted at `note` (default C3). The +2-beat tail past the window is the record's REAL continuation. Cycles are E-DIG-002; a loaderless build is E-DIG-001. A sampler playing a dig record defaults `end` to the musical edge (beats/(beats+2)) — no tail-fraction magic — and `semis: -5` repitches in semitones (pitch slot 0.5 ± n/48)  Both `bounce` and `dig` press STEREO records — the sampler reads both channels through one voice, so the source's width survives (mono assets are untouched, bit-exact) | Your own songs are the records: dig, chop, repitch, rebuild |
| `master 1.6` | Mastering gain: scales the summed mix before the master soft limiter (`tanh`). Brings a finished song to loudness without touching its internal balance | 0.1..4.0 (E-SONG-005), default 1.0 = bit-identical to omitting it |
| song-level `insert comp(...)` / `insert limiter(...)` … | The MASTER-BUS chain: song-level inserts run on the summed mix AFTER the master gain and BEFORE the soft limiter — the glue compressor / EQ / saturation / limiter of a real 2-bus, in written order | Empty = bit-identical bypass; any track insert works here |
| `level -12` (song) / `level -14` (track) | Declarative gain staging in integrated LUFS: the compiler measures the certified render (the track's solo render / the summed mix) and sets the fader / `master` to hit the target — three converging passes at song level so the soft limiter's take is folded in. Deterministic on native and wasm (power-domain math). A fader can only attenuate: an unreachable track target is E-LVL-002 | −36..−6 (E-LVL-001); omitting `level` is bit-identical to today |

### 4.2 Placement

- Bars are **1-based and inclusive at both ends**: `bars(1..8)` = bars 1 through 8.
- `section verse = bars(1..8)` names a range, referenced with `at verse` (E-MOD-003).
- Clip content loops within the placement range (when the pattern length < the range length).

### 4.3 Music Literals

| Literal | Content | Generation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `` beat`x--- X.x-` `` | `x` = hit (vel 100), `X` = accent (120), `.` = ghost (55), `-` = rest. Whitespace is visual grouping | The step count divides one bar equally. Length = 60% of a step. Velocity is reflected as gain on all sound sources (100 = unity) |
| `` beat`x*3 - x*2 -` `` | `*N` after a hit = ratchet: the step subdivides into N rapid retrigs (2..16, E-BEAT-004) | Retrig velocities decay by ×0.78 per hit — the classic stutter/fill shape |
| `` beat`euclid(3, 8)` `` | Bjorklund: k hits spread as evenly as possible over n steps; optional `rot:` rotates. `euclid(3,8)` = `x--x--x-` (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 128, E-BEAT-003) | Expands to plain hits before step processing — layer a second play for accents |
| `` notes`C4:1/2 [E4 G4]:1 _:1` `` | `pitch:length` (in beats). `[…]` = chord, `_` = rest; lengths are `1` `0.5` `1/2` | Placed sequentially. C4 = MIDI 60 |
| `` notes`C2!:1/4 C2~:1/4 D2:1/2` `` | `!` = accent (vel 120), `~` = tie: holds the gate until the next note. Becomes a slide on mono/glide instruments (303 notation). To use both, write `C2!~` | Ties overlap at 102% of the length |
| `` prog`Em \| C G \| D` `` | `\|` = bar. Multiple chords within one bar divide the time equally | ChordEvent sequence. Playing it bare produces block chords |

Chord qualities: (unmarked = major), `m`, `min`, `7`, `maj7`, `m7`, `min7`, `dim`,
`aug`, `sus2`, `sus4`.

### 4.4 Pattern Functions (progression → performance)

| Function | Arguments | Voicing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chords(p)` | — | Holds all chord tones for the chord duration (root oct3, vel 90) |
| `bass(p, rate: 0.5)` | If rate omitted, one note per chord | Root note oct2, vel 100 |
| `arp(p, rate: 0.5, style: "up\|down\|updown")` | rate is 0<r≤1 bar | Cycles through chord tones at oct4, vel 95 |
| `cycle(p, span: 1.5)` | p = beat/notes literal (or let). `span` in beats, 0<span≤128 — **required** (E-PAT-004) | Polymeter: the pattern's period is `span` instead of one bar. A beat literal's steps divide the span; the clip tiles at that period and phases against the meter |
| `humanize(p, time: 0.02, vel: 10, seed: 1)` | p = any literal. `time` ≤ 0.5 beats, `vel` ≤ 60 | Seeded xorshift jitter of note timing and velocity. Deterministic: the same seed renders bit-identically on every machine |
| `late(p, by: 0.04)` | p = any literal. `by` in beats, −0.25..0.25 | Constant micro-shift of every note: + drags behind the grid (the laid-back snare), − pushes ahead (the driving hat). No randomness; nest with humanize() for drag + scatter |

### 4.5 Device DSL (defining instruments and effects in code)

`device Name : Instrument` (sound source) or `device Name : Effect` (effect,
used with `insert`). `param` is bound at instantiation time (range via `in lo..hi`,
default 0..1). An Instrument's graph is expanded into a per-voice interpreter;
polyphony (8 voices, oldest-steal) and envelope release are handled by the engine.
An Effect's graph is evaluated as the same graph with independent state for each stereo channel.

- An Instrument's signal sources are `note.freq / note.gate / note.vel`.
- An Effect's signal source is **`audio.in`** (the input signal). note.* cannot be used
  (E-GRID-003), and `adsr` requires an explicit gate (E-GRID-001).
- Writing an Effect as an instrument, or an Instrument as an insert, is E-DEV-009.
- **Reserved param name `glide`**: declaring it makes the device mono/legato, with the value as portamento seconds.
  Overlapping (tied) notes do not retrigger; the frequency slides instead (the 303 slide).

| Primitive | Signal inputs (defaults) | Parameters (defaults) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `osc` | `freq` (note.freq), `mod` (±4oct), `pwm` (pulse width ±0.45) | `shape`: sine/saw/square/tri/pulse; `pw` (base width for pulse, default 0.5) |
| `noise` | — | — (deterministic: per-voice xorshift, reseeded per note) |
| `lfo` | — | `rate` 0..1 (= 0.05..12Hz), `shape`: sine/tri/saw/square |
| `adsr` | `gate` (note.gate) | `a` .05, `d` .3, `s` .6, `r` .25 (normalized) |
| `svf` | `in` (required), `mod` (±4oct) | `cutoff` .65 (= 30..18kHz exponential), `reso` .2 |
| `vcf` | `in` (required), `mod` (±4oct) | `cutoff` .65, `reso` .2, `drive` 0, `track` 0 (keytracking: 1.0 = cutoff follows the played note), `drift` 0 (deterministic per-voice cutoff spread ±1.2 semitones — no two voices' filters sit alike), `mode`: "ladder" (24 dB, tanh feedback, Moog lineage) / "svf" (12 dB TPT, saturated integrators). Resonance saturates musically; the top of the reso range self-oscillates (a playable sine source). The plain `svf` is untouched — digests stand |
| `shaper` | `in` (required), `mod` (added to drive) | `drive` .3, `mode`: tanh/clip/fold |
| `gain` | `in` (required), `mod` (0..2×) | `level` .8 |
| `mix` | `a`, `b` (required) | — |
| `sample` | — (Instrument only: E-GRID-003 in an Effect) | `take` (required: a declared take slot), `start` 0, `end` 1, `loop`: off/on, `reverse`: off/on |

Signal sources: `note.freq` (Hz) / `note.gate` / `note.vel`, declared `node` names
(forward references disallowed, E-GRID-002), and nested calls. A `param` name may be written in a numeric position.

**take slots (soundnote)**: `take voice` at the top of a device declares that "the user
plugs in a recording". `sample(take: voice)` plays that take as the graph's sound source
(reference pitch C4, repitched to the played note, restarting from the beginning on each note-on),
and it can be processed downstream by svf/shaper/gain. Binding happens at the call site:
`instrument MyVox(voice: myTake)` (unbound is E-DEV-002; a non-Ident is E-TYPE-004).
Since the device itself carries no take, verifying a library alone
(`forte check lib.forte`) passes with the slot unbound —
anyone can plug their own recording into a published instrument.

### 4.6 Built-in Devices

| instrument | Parameters |
| --- | --- |
| `sampler(sample: "Kick"\|"Snare"\|"Hat"\|<bounce name>)` | gain, attack, decay, sustain, release, pitch, start, end, loop("off"/"on"), reverse("off"/"on"), glide (0..1 → 0..0.5 s of mono/legato slide between overlapping notes — the 808/303 slide), slices (2..32: chop the region into pads; root+n plays slice n at ORIGINAL speed — the MPC chop), choke("off"/"on": every new trigger hard-cuts all running voices with a ~3 ms fade — the MPC mono pad; the cut and the rest it leaves is the groove), vary (0..1: deterministic per-hit pitch/level drift, ±35 cents / ±12 % at 1.0, keyed to the trigger counter — no two hits identical, kills the machine-gun tell), stretch (granular time-stretch: 0 = off; otherwise the TIMELINE speed — 0.5 = original tempo, 0.25 = half, 1.0 = double — while the note only sets grain pitch. Time and pitch decoupled: half-speed drums that stay in key, melodies whose notes all last the same length. Automatable and read live — ride it toward 0.02 for a granular freeze with no pitch fall, the anti-tapestop. Deterministic 50 %-overlap triangle grains, ~50 ms), semis (-24..24: repitch in semitones — pitch slot 0.5 ± n/48, no magic fractions; also an automation target: `automate semis from 0 to -5 over bars(..)`), warp("on": dig records only — sets stretch so the record's beats land on the SONG's beats, granular time-stretch tempo-sync) |
| `sampler(take: <imported recording>, root: A3)` | Same as above. A recorded take becomes an instrument: `root` is the note name (C2..C6) at which the take was performed; playing that note gives the original sound, others are repitched chromatically |
| `sampler(…, start: 0.25, end: 0.6, loop: "on", reverse: "on")` | Sound design: `start`/`end` set the playback range (as a 0..1 fraction), `loop: "on"` loops the range while the note is held (short ranges become sustained tones), `reverse: "on"` plays in reverse. All are fixed at note-on time, preserving determinism |
| `kit(C2: kickTake, D2: snareTake, …)` | gain, attack, decay, sustain, release, pitch, vary. Note-name keys assign recorded takes OR bounce samples to pads (an exactly matching pitch plays that pad at original speed) — a pad can be a whole produced MOMENT, a block bounced with its insert chains. `vary` (0..1) drifts each trigger's pitch/level deterministically, same semantics as the sampler's. A `beat` literal strikes the lowest-pitched pad |
| `kit(C1: kickMoment, wrap: MomentAll)` | The RACK: `wrap:` names a recording/bounce that every UNMAPPED key plays, repitched chromatically from the wrap's root — mapped pads stay raw components, every other key replays the whole composite in the audio domain (echo tails and formants bend with the note). `pitch` (0.5 = centre, ±24 semi) transposes the wrap layer and is automatable — held wrap notes bend live |
| `prisma` | wave(sine/saw/square/tri), cutoff, reso, attack, decay, sustain, release, detune, sub, filtenv, unison(1..7 voices), spread — `unison: 5` replaces the classic osc pair with five oscillators fanned across ±`detune`·45 cents and equal-power panned across ±`spread`: the width of modern melodic production. `unison: 1` (default) is the bit-exact mono voice |
| `mesh()` | Modular sound source with a default patch |

Beyond the built-ins, a standard instrument library `packages/essentials_0.6.0/instruments/` (drums / percussion / bass /
keys / leads / pads / synths / fx, 103 instruments in total) is bundled. These are not a language feature but
user-space code written in the device DSL of §4.5, used via ordinary `import`.

| effect | Parameters |
| --- | --- |
| `filter` | type(lp/hp/bp/notch), cutoff, reso |
| `eq` | low, mid, high |
| `drive` | drive (alias amount), os("off"/"2x"/"4x") |
| `delay` | time, fdbk (alias feedback), mix |
| `reverb` | size, decay, mix |
| `comp` | thresh, ratio, attack, release, makeup — stereo-linked compressor |
| `chorus` | rate, depth, mix — modulated delay with L/R quadrature phase |
| `pump` | amount, beats — tempo-synced ducking (a deterministic version of sidechain pumping. beats is the number of beats per cycle, default 1)|
| `crush` | bits, rate, mix, os("off"/"2x"/"4x") — bit-depth (16→1 across 0..1) + sample-rate reduction (hold 1..64 samples). The lo-fi/glitch crunch. With `os` on, the whole sample-and-hold core runs oversampled (hold length preserved in seconds) and the fold-back above the audible band is filtered off |
| `stutter` | beats, mix — tempo-synced buffer repeat: the last `beats` of dry signal loop while mix is up. Automate `stutter.mix` for glitch fills |
| `gate` | depth, beats, duty — tempo-synced chopper (trance gate): open for `duty` of each cycle, closed by `depth` for the rest, 1 ms anti-click slew |
| `saturate` | mode("tape"/"tube"/"fuzz"), drive, tone, mix, os("off"/"2x"/"4x") — waveshaping saturation: tape = warm symmetric, tube = asymmetric even harmonics, fuzz = pedal aggression. `tone` darkens post-shape so heavy drive stays musical. `os` runs the waveshaper at 2x/4x through linear-phase halfbands so its harmonics stop folding back as inharmonic aliasing (default off = bit-exact legacy path; the oversampled wet is latency-matched to the dry blend, and the insert as a whole runs ~0.7 ms late) |
| `transient` | attack, sustain (0.5 = neutral, ±12 dB) — fast/slow follower split: shape the hit and the body independently, before compression |
| `parcomp` | amount, drive, color, os("off"/"2x"/"4x") — parallel (New York) compression in one insert: a hard-compressed copy (8:1, fast, makeup, `color` = smiley tilt) blended UNDER the dry. Punch and glue without losing dynamics. `os` oversamples the crushed bus so its safety clip stops aliasing |
| `exciter` | amount, freq — saturated high band mixed on top: synthesized sparkle where the source has none |
| `ringmod` | freq (20 Hz..4 kHz log), mix — sine-carrier multiplication: inharmonic, metallic, the broken-machine voice |
| `tapestop` | amount — 0 is a bit-exact bypass; automate toward 1 and a buffered read head slows to a halt, pitch falling like power-cut tape |
| `limiter` | ceiling (output peak ceiling, 0.05..1), release (knob 0..1 → 10 ms..~1 s) — instant-attack peak limiter: nothing crosses the ceiling, loudness without the soft-clip crunch. Built for the master bus, works anywhere |
| `glue` | thresh, ratio, attack, release, knee, schpf, makeup, mix — the program-dependent bus compressor: RMS+peak hybrid detector behind a sidechain highpass (`schpf` keeps the kick's sub from pumping the bus), soft knee, and a release that slides up to 8x slower the longer reduction has persisted (transients recover in tens of ms, sustained squash breathes out slowly). 2.5 ms lookahead — the attack has already seen the transient it catches; the whole insert runs that late. `mix` under 1.0 = parallel compression. `comp` is untouched |
| `space` | type("room"/"plate"/"hall"), size, decay (T60 0.2..12 s), damp (high-frequency decay), predelay (0..150 ms), mod (deterministic tail modulation — alive, not metallic), width, mix — the new-generation reverb: diffused input into an 8-line modulated FDN with frequency-dependent decay and a decorrelated stereo tail. The old `reverb` is untouched (its digests are load-bearing) |
| `vinyl` | wow, crackle, hiss, dust — the analog-media patina that makes digital sources read as RECORDINGS: `wow` = slow ±pitch drift + 6.5 Hz flutter (the warped record), `crackle` = sparse deterministic ticks/pops, `hiss` = shaped surface-noise floor, `dust` = darkening lowpass (worn-pressing rolloff). Each stage gates on its knob; all-zero = bit-exact bypass. Defaults are already a record: `insert vinyl()` |
| `duck(from: Kick, amount, attack, release, shape, mode)` | Sidechain ducker — the glitch groove engine. `from:` names another track; the compiler bakes that track's (swung) hit times and this insert slams its input's gain down by `amount` (1 = to silence) over `attack`, then recovers over `release` (`shape` 0 linear, 1 snappy). The unnatural cuts and the space between them ARE the groove. Deterministic (baked triggers). Missing source is E-DUCK-002. `mode: "key"` flips the polarity: SILENT by default, the gate opens only on the key track's hits — the sidechain CHOP (a held pad carved by a hat pattern), where the default `"duck"` is the sidechain pump |
| `width` | amount — M/S stereo width (0.5 is unity. Since insert is pre-pan, use on stereo sources)|

All numeric knobs are normalized 0..1 (out of range is E-TYPE-002). volume 0..1, pan -1..1,
send level 0..1.

### 4.7 Recording Assets (.frec)

- `import take from "./take1.frec"` → `audio take at bars(2..3)`.
- **Audio without provenance cannot even be referenced** (E-PROV-001): the header's provenance requires
  `device_class` (microphone / midi-render), `recorded_at`, `by`, `session`,
  and `sig`. The loopback calibration value is bundled as `latency_samples`.
- Layout: `FREC1\n` + u32-le header length + JSON header + f32-le PCM.
  Rate 8k..192k, 1..2ch (stereo plays back as a mono mix).
- Importing external audio (WAV/MP3, etc.) **does not exist at the grammar level**.

### 4.8 Module Resolution

- Paths are relative to the importing file. Resolution is recursive; cycles are E-MOD-007.
- If a name is absent, the library's actual exports are listed (E-MOD-006).
- Environments: CLI/LSP = filesystem, browser = the editor's file map (OPFS + bundled).

### 4.9 Automation and Modulation

Resolution of the target parameter is shared by automate / modulate (case-insensitive):

- `volume` (automate only) / an instrument's parameter name — built-ins
  (prisma / sampler) use the parameter tables; **for user-defined devices, the declared `param`
  is the name as-is**.
- `<insertName>.<parameter>` — refers to an insert effect by the name it was written with:
  `delay.mix`, `Muffle.cutoff` (a user-defined Effect's `param`s are also exposed).
  If multiple inserts share a name, the first one is targeted.

Unknown names produce E-AUTO-001 / E-LFO-001 with a list of "what is available".

- `automate <param> from 0.2 to 0.8 over bars(1..8)` — a linear ramp from the start to the end
  of the range (`over` also accepts a section name). Values are 0..1 (E-TYPE-002).
  For parameters with a lane, the base value is replaced by the lane: before the ramp begins
  it holds `from`, and after it ends it holds `to`. Multiple `automate`s are merged, per target,
  into a single lane in beat order.
- `modulate <param> with <modulator>(…) [as <name>]` — plugs a modulator into a
  parameter. There are 4 kinds — or the name of a body-level shared modulator
  (below); anything else is E-LFO-005 listing what exists:
  - `lfo(rate: 0.4, amount: 0.5, shape: "tri")` — periodic wave. `rate` 0..1
    (0.05..8.05 Hz, default 0.3), `shape` sine / tri / saw / square
    (default sine).
  - `steps(seq: "0.1 0.6 0.3 0.9", every: "1/16", amount: 0.5)` —
    step sequencer. `seq` is whitespace-separated 0..1 values (E-TYPE-002).
    Writing `every` (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16. E-TYPE-005) makes it **tempo-synced**:
    1 step = that note value. If omitted, it cycles once per the free-running period of `rate`.
  - `random(rate: 0.4, amount: 0.4, smooth: 0.5)` — sample & hold
    randomness (deterministic: the same source yields the same random sequence). `smooth` 0..1 smoothly
    interpolates between steps. Tempo sync via `every` is also possible.
  - `adsr(a: 0.02, d: 0.4, s: 0.3, r: 0.1)` — a **note-gate-driven** external
    envelope: rises when the track starts sounding and
    releases when it goes silent (a retrofitted filter envelope). Each value 0..1
    (times follow a squared curve up to 3 seconds max). Evaluated at block rate.
  Common: `amount` -1..1 is **required** (E-LFO-003). The wobble rides on the base value
  (the lane value at that moment, if an automate lane exists) with a width of amount,
  saturating to 0..1. `automate` and `modulate` **can be layered** on a single parameter
  (modulation rides on top of the ramp), and multiple `modulate`s can be
  stacked as well.

#### Naming a modulator: `as`, and automating the modulator itself

`modulate cutoff with lfo(rate: 0.3, amount: 0.2) as wobble` names the
modulator. A named modulator exposes two automation targets:

- `automate wobble.amount from 0 to 0.6 over build` — a **depth** ramp that
  scales every route of that modulator (the wobble deepens into the drop);
- `automate wobble.rate from 0.1 to 0.8 over build` — the speed knob.

Both are ordinary lanes (0..1, merged per target, evaluated at block rate
before the modulators run each block).

#### Macros: one knob, many parameters

```forte
macro brightness {
  route cutoff   amount: 0.8
  route delay.mix amount: 0.3
}
automate brightness from 0.1 to 0.9 over drop
```

A `macro` (track item) declares a knob that fans out to any number of
`route <param> amount: <-1..1>` targets — instrument params and
`insert.param` alike, across devices. The knob starts at **0** (a declared
but untouched macro is a no-op) and is driven by automating the macro's
bare name. `name.amount` / `name.rate` also work on macros. Unknown route
targets are E-AUTO-001; a bare name that is neither a param nor a macro is
E-AUTO-001 with the known modulator names appended.

#### Shared modulators: body-level `let`

```forte
let groove = lfo(rate: 0.25, amount: 0.3)
track A { … modulate cutoff  with groove }
track B { … modulate delay.mix with groove(amount: 0.15) }
```

`let <name> = lfo|steps|random|adsr(…)` at body level declares a shared
modulator **definition**. `modulate … with <name>(…)` copies the definition
into that track (call-site args override the let's args), so every user
runs with identical parameters and phase — the whole song breathes at one
rate. Pure sugar: the render is bit-identical to writing the same
modulator inline on each track. Inheritance overrides `let` definitions by
name, like music `let`s.

### 4.9.5 Metadata: desc and tags

Every body (song or block) may carry one-line metadata at the top:

```forte
block AcidLine {
  desc "A 4-bar 303 acid line in A minor; the filter opens while it plays."
  tags "acid, bass, 303, house"
  …
}
```

- `desc` is the piece's own words — `forte play` prints the ROOT block's
  desc above the timeline; catalogs, packages and the browser use it when
  browsing and importing.
- `tags` is a comma-separated keyword list for search.
- `license "CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0"` declares the content license the body is
  published under (packages declare it; catalogs and players display it).
  The repository's package content defaults to CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 — see
  `packages/LICENSE`: forking and remixing the source is free and
  non-commercial; commercially exploiting rendered audio requires the
  rights holder's permission.
- `version "0.6.0"` names the package/block version. `forte package add`
  vendors a package into `packages/<name>_<version>/`, so the version is
  part of the on-disk identity and two versions can coexist.
- `requires "github:owner/repo[@ref]"` (repeatable) declares a package
  dependency. `forte package add` resolves requires recursively and hoists
  every dependency into the consumer's ONE flat `packages/` directory —
  vendored packages never contain a nested `packages/` of their own.
- **`package.lock`** (written by add/update, checked by `forte package
  verify`) pins each vendored package as sorted JSON entries
  `{name, version, source, commit, digest}` — `commit` is the upstream
  git HEAD at fetch time (the base for update's three-way merge),
  `digest` is FNV-1a 64 over the vendored tree (sorted rel-path + bytes;
  the same hash family as the build digest). `forte package update
  <name>` re-fetches: a pristine copy is replaced, a locally-edited copy
  is three-way merged (base = the locked commit; conflicts or a
  non-compiling merge abort; `--force` overwrites with a backup), and
  the change is reported through the semantic differ.
- `artist "…"` names who made the piece. Albums declare it in their
  `album.forte` meta block; songs may carry their own; players display it.
- `sponsor "https://…"` is where listeners can support the author.
  `forte package list`, the web catalog and the players surface it, and
  it rides into every .fortesong's credits built from the package.
- Inheritance: a child's `desc`/`tags`/`license`/`version`/`requires`/
  `artist`/`sponsor` override the parent's when present.
- A root block with a `desc` and no tracks/placements is a valid,
  deliberately silent file — the shape of `packages/<pkg>/package.forte`
  metadata blocks (an EMPTY root without a desc is still E-SONG-003).

### 4.10 Blocks (the universal composition unit)

A `block Name { … }` is a self-contained piece of music with the same body
as a song: tracks, lets, sections, returns, automation — and placements of
other blocks. Composition in Forte IS nesting blocks: refine a part inside a
block, then a higher block decides WHEN it plays, in WHICH key, and connects
it to other blocks. The outermost block you build is "the song".

- **Placement**: `play Groove(key: "E minor", from: 2, to: 5) at bars(9..16)`
  (also `at <section>`). Content loops when the placement span is longer
  than the block (window length rounded up to whole bars).
- **External control** (placement-level, the placing body's timeline):
  - `play Riff(volume: 0.6) at bars(9..16)` scales the WHOLE instance —
    every track's fader — for that span only, then restores it. The same
    block placed elsewhere is untouched, and the block's internal mix
    (per-track volumes, its own automation) is preserved: values are
    fader-relative.
  - `automate Riff.volume from 0 to 1 over intro` fades a placed instance
    from the outside (0 = silent, 1 = the block's own mix). Targets must
    be `<placement>.volume` in v1; unknown placements are E-AUTO-002 with
    the placed names listed.
  - `play Riff(swing: 0.66)` gives the instance's subtree its own groove
    (grid 16ths, 0.5..0.8 — E-TYPE-002 outside); the root's swing still
    governs everything not overridden. `play Riff(stretch: 2)` scales the
    block's time — 2 = half-time (every beat doubles), 0.5 = double-time,
    range 0.25..4. Stretch applies BEFORE windows and loops, so `from`/
    `to` and the placement span speak stretched bars; recorded audio
    moves but plays at its own speed (audio cannot timestretch).
  - **Public knobs**: a block declares `param cutoff = 0.5 in 0..1`
    (device syntax) and references the name in its instrument/insert args
    (`instrument Bass303(cutoff: cutoff)`). A placement sets it with
    `play Riff(cutoff: 0.7)` — unknown names are E-BLOCK-005 listing the
    declared ones, out-of-range values are E-TYPE-002. Because instances
    of one block share tracks, every placement of a block must agree on
    its knob values (E-BLOCK-005 otherwise — inherit with
    `block Dark : Riff { param cutoff = 0.1 in 0..1 }` for a different
    sound). Inheritance replaces same-name param declarations.
- **The block above always wins**: the root's `tempo` / `swing` / `meter` /
  `key` govern the entire render. A placed block's own `tempo` is ignored;
  its own `key` is the *reference* its transposition is computed from.
- **Transposition**: the effective key at a placement is the placement's
  `key:` override, or the effective key inherited from above. Melodic
  content (`notes` / `prog` / pattern functions) transposes by the minimal
  signed interval from the block's native key root to the effective root;
  **`beat` literals never transpose** (pads and drums stay put).
- **Windows**: `from`/`to` select bars inside the block (1-based, inclusive).
  A clip cut at the head keeps its loop phase (content is rotated).
- **Flattening**: placements compile away — each placed block's tracks merge
  into the parent as `Block.Track` named tracks; the same block placed twice
  shares tracks (one more set of clips), so mixer/inserts exist once. Sends
  resolve within the block. Nested definitions (`block` inside a body) are
  local and shadow imported names. Cycles are E-BLOCK-002; an unknown block
  lists what exists (E-BLOCK-001); flattening past the engine's 64-track
  limit is E-BLOCK-003; an empty from/to window is E-BLOCK-004.
- **Aliases (`as`)**: `play AcidPeak as Acid at drop` names the *instance*.
  Placements sharing an alias share ONE set of tracks (`Alias.Track`), so a
  family of inherited variants reads as a single evolving lane — the same
  track plays the intro pattern, then the peak pattern with different
  insert settings, one section after another. Structure comes from the
  first placement; later placements must keep the same instrument/insert
  shape (patterns, param values, `volume`/`pan`, automation and modulation
  may differ) — a mismatch is E-BLOCK-007. Public-knob agreement
  (E-BLOCK-005) and `automate <name>.volume` placement automation are keyed
  by the alias when present.
- **Import**: `import { Groove } from "./blocks/groove.forte"` — importing a
  block also carries the devices of its home module (first definition of a
  name wins).
- **Inheritance**: `block Child : Parent { … }` — the child starts from the
  parent's (recursively resolved) body and overrides, class-style:
  - same-name track: `instrument` replaces; a same-name `insert` has its
    params replaced, a new insert appends; non-empty `play`/`audio` lists
    replace the parent's; `volume`/`pan` override; `automate`/`modulate`
    stack on top; `send`s merge by destination.
  - new tracks and returns append; `let`/`section` override by name; the
    header (`tempo`/`swing`/`meter`/`key`) overrides field by field.
  - chains resolve recursively (`A : B : C`); an unknown parent is
    E-BLOCK-005, an inheritance cycle is E-BLOCK-006.

## 5. The Determinism Contract

1. Same source + same assets → **bit-identical builds** (verified on native x86_64 / wasm32-wasip1 /
   browser wasm. `scripts/determinism_test.sh` is the CI gate).
2. Conditions: fixed f32, transcendental functions from a single libm implementation (dawcore::dmath),
   rendering at 48kHz, 512-sample blocks, 8-beat tail.
3. Build proof: output digest = FNV-1a 64 over the f32 LE bit patterns of all samples
   (v1; the production version will move to SHA-256). Recorded in `build.manifest.json` and the Hub release
   ledger; `forte hub verify` / the browser's Verify performs reproduction matching.

## 6. Canonical Form (fmt)

`forte fmt` is the sole formatter: indentation of brace depth × 2 spaces, no trailing whitespace,
at most 1 blank line, exactly 1 trailing newline. Strings, music literals, and comments are unchanged.
**If the token sequences before and after formatting do not match, application is refused** (E-FMT-001) — a
meaning-changing format is structurally impossible.

## 8. Differences from the v0 Draft / Unimplemented

- Implemented and finalized from v0: send/return syntax (DECISION-S1), the prog quality set,
  the device DSL in node-graph form (arbitrary-expression `process` is future work).
- Implemented (v1.1): `automate` (volume + all parameters of instrument / insert,
  §4.9), `modulate … with lfo / steps / random / adsr` (including user-defined devices'
  and user-defined Effects' `param`s, and `<insert>.<param>`, §4.9).
- Unimplemented (v2 candidates): user-defined generics, automate pan, macros
  (1 knob → many parameters), automation of modulators themselves
  (`wobble.amount`), song-level shared modulators, triplet beat literals
  (DECISION-S2), first-class expression of section repetition (DECISION-S3),
  full unit-type checking (Hz/dB/ms), explicit `route` routing,
  actual verification of ed25519 signatures. (The effect device DSL is implemented per §4.5)


### 4.5.1 `resonator` (modal / physical modeling)

`resonator(in:, freq:, ring:, fm:, key:, strike:)` — a tuned two-pole modal resonator. Excited by `in` (a short noise burst or impulse) it RINGS at `freq` (0..1, mapped 30 Hz..18 kHz like a filter cutoff) for `ring` seconds (0..1 -> 3 ms..1.2 s to -60 dB). `fm` shifts the frequency up to +-4 octaves (pitch-drop envelopes = a drum head detuning). Stack several at inharmonic frequencies for drums, bells, plates and plucks — physical-modeling percussion with no samples. Deterministic (a pure difference equation).

Two options unlock melodic physical modeling:

- `key: "on"` — the mode follows the PLAYED NOTE: `freq` becomes a note-relative ratio (0.5 = the note itself, each 0.125 = one octave, so 0.625 = 2nd partial, 0.698 = 3rd, 0.75 = 4th). Strings, tines, bars and bells that track the score; leave it off for fixed body modes (a guitar body does not move with the note — that immovable resonance is what reads as "an instrument").
- `strike: "on"` — input normalization for BURST excitation: the ring of an impulse peaks near unity regardless of ring length or frequency. Without it the default steady-state normalization (resonant peak of a sustained input ≈ unity) swallows a short excitation almost entirely on long rings. Struck physical modeling wants `strike: "on"`; filter-like use of a sustained signal wants the default.
